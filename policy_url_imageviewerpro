Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse 
     
We declared that Image Viewer Pro Apps do NOT distribute any user data outside of the Apps.
 
The primary Apps users supposed to be users(like learners) where they might prefer alernative (or hopefully productive way) to view large amount of image slides by quicker switching between different image slides. 
Also, they might capture image using camera, or take snapshot from their videos.

All content is used within the app.
The image folder might be exported by user to under Pictures folder. 
Also, there is no Ads, and also not a news Apps.

Hope Enjoy the Apps,
