Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse 
     
We declared that Good Image Browser Apps do NOT distribute any user data outside of the Apps.
 
The primary Apps users supposed to be learners where they captured images as notes from school, 
and they might review the image notes using a image browser before the exams.

Another target users include adult learners, who might have capture image notes and need to review them before job interview, 
or for other revision needs.

There is no data distributed or used outside the Apps. All images captured ONLY stayed in user device storage.
Also, there is no Ads, and also not a news Apps.
