Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse 
     
We declared that Good Image Browser Apps do NOT collect any user data.
The Apps is simply a viewer of images.

The primary Apps users supposed to be learners where they captured images from school or other sources 
such as slides, and they might review the image notes using a image browser before the exams.

There is no data collected in the Apps, and therefore there is no data used outside of Apps.
Also, there is no Ads, and also not a news Apps.
