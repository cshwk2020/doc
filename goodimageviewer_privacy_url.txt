Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse 
     
We declared that Good Image Viewer Apps do NOT colect NOR distribute any user data outside of the Apps.
 
The primary Apps users supposed to be users(like learners) where they might prefer alernative (or hopefully productive way) to view large amount of image slides by quicker switching between different image slides. 

All content is used within the app.
There is no data distributed or used outside the Apps.  
Also, there is no Ads, and also not a news Apps.

Hope Enjoy the Apps,
